      <h2>Preventative Measures for Teenage Substance Abuse</h2>
      <h4>Family Influence</h4>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Prevention of drug and alcohol abuse can start at home. Parents can talk to their children and explain the
        consequences of drug and alcohol abuse. Specifically talking to children while they are young can create a
        strong foundation for awareness of drug use. This helps parents positively influence their children, while
        teaching their children about boundaries.
        <br />
        In teaching boundaries, parents help children to understand when to deny something that can hurt them, while
        controlling the dynamic of an unhealthy request. Prevention talks also create deeper bonds and guidance between
        children and parents. Parents can establish consistency in communication, as well as guidance that can be
        followed for years. Preventative conversations can lead the adolescent to strengthen trust with their parent,
        and make wise decisions with habits, friends, interests, and influences.
      </p>
      <h4>Educational Tools</h4>
      There are governmental agencies, community leaders, and school personnel that attempt to teach children about
      living a drug-free life. Much of this is to prevent teen drug abuse before they reach adulthood or go into the
      real world. As a result of these educational tools, teen drug abuse has significantly decreased from previous
      decades.
      <br />
      Educating teens on the effects of drug abuse is important as it attempts to control possible drug use before the
      age of maturity. There are presently various educational programs in place for this very reason, including:
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Universal</li>
        <li>Selective</li>
        <li>Indicated</li>
      </ul>
      Universal programs function to teach social, personal, and drug resistance techniques on a weekly basis. <br />
      Selective
      programs are interventions for teens who may be more at risk and have unstable home lives, or other risk factors.
      <br />
      Indicated educational programs are geared to teens showing problematic behavior.


      <h2>Stop Addiction Before It Gets Worse</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Prevention strategies can help stop teens from developing a substance use disorder; however, treatment is best
        for teens who already have a problem. Treatment puts teens in the care of medical professionals with tools for
        recovery. For instance, teens may not realize there are underlying conditions that may encourage substance
        abuse, known as co-occurring disorders. These would be treated with cutting-edge medication and therapy. Detox
        is completed under the hand of a medical professional to ensure support. Perhaps most importantly, therapies and
        peer groups encourage a feeling of health and belonging. Contact a treatment specialist to locate facilities
        catering to teen-related treatment today.
